1.  Implementing Serializable in the CalendarEvent class is necessary because it
    allows the object to be converted into a byte stream, which can then be easily
    sent over a network or stored in a file. This is essential in a client-server
    setup where you want to transmit objects (like CalendarEvent) between the client and the server.

2.  The LocalDateTime class from the java.time package is used. Its variables are as follows:
        year : int
        month : int
        dayOfMonth : int
        hour : int
        minute : int
        second : int
        nano : int
    Functions likely to be used are as follows:
        of(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth, int hour, int minute):
            Creates a LocalDateTime instance with specified
            year, month, day, hour, minute, and optionally second and nanosecond.
        now(): Gets the current date and time from the system clock.
        parse(CharSequence text): Parses a string in the ISO-8601 format
            (e.g., 2024-10-30T15:45) to create a LocalDateTime.
