[1] Since ActionListener is an interface, it only provides the method declaration (not the implementation).
You must provide your own implementation for the actionPerformed method. By overriding it,
you're defining what the program should do when the button is clicked.
        loginButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {...} );
